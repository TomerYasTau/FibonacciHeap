# Fibonacci Heap Project

This is our second assignment for the "Data Structures" course, Tel Aviv University, 2025B semester.  
We implement a Fibonacci Heap in Java, along with experimental analysis.

## 👥 Contributors
- Tomer [TomerYasTau]
- Ofer [oferdadia]

## 📁 Project Structure
```
FibonacciHeapProject/
├── src/
│   └── FibonacciHeap.java
├── info.txt
├── README.md
└── .gitignore
```

## 🛠 Instructions
- Code is written in Java 21.
- Git is used for version control.
- The `src` folder contains the implementation.
- Use branches for collaborative work (`tomer-dev`, `ofer-dev`, etc).
- Before pushing to `main`, changes should be merged via pull request or tested locally.

## 🧪 Experimental Part
- Will be documented in a separate PDF (`FibonacciHeap_yasqulka_oferdadia.pdf`) as required.
- Code related to the experiments may be kept locally and does not need to be submitted.

## 📦 Build & Run
You can compile the code using:
```bash
javac src/FibonacciHeap.java
```
Run your tests separately, or include a local `main` (not submitted).

Good luck to us 🚀
